You can list the areas of the system. The areas are a set of sensors that are grouped together
and can be armed and disarmed together. The areas can be sorted manually with drag and drop.

Areas have only a name and a list of assigned sensors. If you want to move a sensor to another area, you can do it by editing the sensor and changing the area.

Areas can be deleted if they have no sensors assigned.
