<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Access-User-orange?style=square">

Registering a device for the security system will enable a specific
user to access the system from the registered device (PC, mobile, etc.).
Users should receive registration codes from the administrator(s) of the system.
Every registration code is unique and can be used only once.

Accepted registration code formats:

* ABC-DEF-123
* ABCDEF123
* abc-def-123
* abcdef123

!!! info
    Default registration code of admin: ABCD1234

Administrators can [generate registration codes](../end_users/users.md#device-registration).

If you don't have access to any registered device, but you have SSH access you can [restore access](../security_engineers/restore_access.md).
