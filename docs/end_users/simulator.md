# Testing Your ArPI System with the Simulator

The ArPI simulator allows you to test your home security system without physical sensors. This is perfect for:

- **Initial setup**: Test your system configuration before installing real sensors
- **Troubleshooting**: Verify if issues are hardware or software related  
- **Learning**: Understand how the system works before committing to hardware
- **Demonstrations**: Show the system functionality

!!! info "What You'll Need"
    - A computer with WiFi capability
    - Basic knowledge of using SSH (secure shell)
    - 30-45 minutes of setup time

## Get the ArPI Image

1. **Download the latest ArPI image** from the official releases:
    - Visit: [ArPI Releases](https://github.com/ArPIHomeSecurity/arpi_management/releases)
    - Download the `.img.xz` file (latest version)

2. **Flash the image to SD card**:
    - Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://rpi.org/imager) or [Balena Etcher](https://balena.io/etcher)
    - Select the downloaded ArPI image
    - Flash to a 16GB+ SD card

## Configure WiFi

Since ArPI runs headless (no monitor), you need to configure WiFi before first boot on the SD card 
after flashing the image:

1. Open the SD card on your computer. 
    You'll see two partitions:
    - **boot** partition (visible on all systems)
    - **rootfs** partition (visible on Linux/macOS)
2. Create wifi passphrase hash:
```bash
$ wpa_passphrase <<YourWiFiName>> <<YourWiFiPassword>>
network={
    ssid="YourWiFiName"
    #psk="YourWiFiPassword"
    psk=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
}
```
Use the `psk` value from the output in the next steps.

### Method 1: NetworkManager

This is the recommended method for configuring WiFi on ArPI.

1. **Create WiFi connection file** in the `rootfs` partition at `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/wifi.nmconnection`:
```
ini
[connection]
id=wifi
type=wifi
autoconnect=true

[wifi]
mode=infrastructure
ssid=<<YourWiFiName>>

[wifi-security]
auth-alg=open
key-mgmt=wpa-psk
psk=<<YourWiFiPassword>>

[ipv4]
method=auto

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=default
method=auto
```

2. **Set permissions** (Linux/macOS only):
```bash
sudo chmod 600 /rootfs/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/wifi.nmconnection
sudo chown root:root /rootfs/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/wifi.nmconnection
```

### Method 2: wpa_supplicant

This is a legacy method, but still works if you prefer it.

```ini
country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="<<YourWiFiName>>"
    psk="<<YourWiFiPassword>>"
}
```

## Connect with SSH

1. Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and power on
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the system to boot and connect to WiFi
3. Connect via SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh argus@arpi.local
   ```

5. **Enter the password** you set during imaging (default: `Argus.1234`)

!!! tip "Connection Issues?"
    - Ensure your computer and Raspberry Pi are on the same WiFi network
    - Try `ping arpi.local` to test basic connectivity
    - Verify the connection file was created with correct permissions

## Enable Simulator Mode

Once connected via SSH, enable the simulator mode:

1. Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd /home/argus/server
```

2. Edit the configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano .env
```

3. Add or modify the simulator setting:
```bash
# Find and change or add this line:
USE_SIMULATOR=true
```

4. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)

5. Restart the ArPI service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart argus_monitor
```

6. Verify the service is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status argus_monitor
```

You should see "active (running)" in green.

## Connect to Web Interface

1. Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://arpi.local`

2. Register your device (first time only):
   - Use default registration code: `ABCD1234`

3. Log in to the system:
   - Default access code: `1234`
   

## Configure system

### Add a sensor

1. Navigate to Sensors in the web interface:
    - Click on "Sensors" in the main menu
    - Click "Add Sensor"

2. Configure the sensor:
    - **Channel**: Select `CH01` (this must match the simulator)
    - **Type**: Choose `Open/Closed` or `Motion Detector`
    - **Description**: Enter something like "Front Door Test"
    - **Enabled**: Make sure it's checked âœ…
    - **Area**: Assign to an area (create one if needed)
    - **Zone**: Assign to a zone (create one if needed)
    - **Zone Settings**: set delays to 0 seconds for testing

3. Save the sensor configuration

### Start the simulator

1. In your SSH terminal, start the simulator:
```bash
cd /home/argus/server
./src/simulator.py
```

2. You'll see a text-based interface with:
   - **Left panel**: 15 channel buttons (CH01-CH15) + POWER
   - **Right panel**: Keypad and 3 RFID cards
   - **Bottom panel**: System outputs (relays, indicators, siren)

### Test functionality

1. Arm your system via the web interface:
    - Go to the main dashboard
    - Click "Arm" for your area

2. Trigger the sensor in the simulator:
    - Click the CH01 button in the simulator
    - The button should turn RED (indicating triggered state)

3. Verify the alarm:
    - Check the web interface for alarm notification
    - Look for changes in the simulator's output panel
    - You should see system responses (R1 for siren, etc.)

4. Test disarming:
    - Use the keypad in the simulator to enter your access code
    - Or click one of the RFID card buttons
    - Verify the system disarms
