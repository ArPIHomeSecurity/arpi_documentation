You can configure the behavior of the syren. The syren can be turned off in case of an alert with the
"silent alarm" option. In case of a silent alarm the syren will not sound, but the system will send
a notification to the configured recipients.

The start of the syren can be delayed with the "delay" option. The delay is in seconds.

You can also limit the duration of the syren with the "stop time" option. The stop time is in seconds.

The "Test" button will sound the syren for 5 seconds. This is useful for testing the syren.
