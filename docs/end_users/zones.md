# Zone list

You can list the zones of the system. The zones are a set of sensors that are grouped together.
The zones can be sorted manually with drag and drop.

The configuration of the zone displays the alert and arm delays of the sensors based on the arm state.

The zone shows the list of the assigned sensors. If you want to move a sensor to another zone, you can do it by editing the sensor and changing the zone.

Zones can be deleted if they have no sensors assigned.

When editing a zone, you can change the name of the zone and a longer description.

Use the check boxes if you want to enable alerting in the given arm state. You can set a delay before arming
the sensors and a delay before alerting.

For creating a tamper zone you have to enable the alerting in all the arm states and set the delays to 0.
